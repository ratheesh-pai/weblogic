### **About extending Oracle Fusion Applications by adding Managed Attachments using Application Composer based Standard Business Objects**

The objective of this lab is to implement the ability to add attachments respective to a given record in **Service** - **Service Requests** module as an example. A standard business object associated with the module makes a SOAP call to WebCenter Content Grant webservices to get a URL with unique managed attachment GUID. This managed attachments page is inserted as a mashup in the module's page. The managed attachments page section is then used for attaching documents specific to the record.
